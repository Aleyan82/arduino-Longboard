Ringbuffer.h

	SERIAL_BUFFER_SIZE is 256 instead of 64 to account for the CDCSerial class requirements


hooks.h
hooks.c

	sysTickHook(), svcHook() and pendSVHook() are not implemented as they are part of libstm32l4_dragonfly.a


Uart.h

	availableForWrite() has been added as UART output is buffered
	write(buffer, size) has been added as UART output is buffered (more efficient to write a numbers if bytes)


CDC.h

	based upon HardwareSerial


Reset.h

	tickReset() not available; code aequivalent implemented in libstm32l4_dragonfly.a


wiring_analog.h

	analogReference() not available do to hardware

wiring_digital.c

	digitalWrite() is documented pre 1.0.1 to set the pullup on a INPUT pin; this is not supported.

WInterrupts.c
	
	LOW & HIGH are ignored ... pointless ...
